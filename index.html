<p>Everyone knows that feeling when they get that special notification that their countdown to get ready for the date has begun. Does that countdown speed by too quickly? Did you just get that notification and you are not ready? Uh oh! Do you have an exciting (yet unsuspected) date or hookup mesh in a few hours and do you need to get a few last things done?</p>
